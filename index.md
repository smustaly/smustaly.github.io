My name is Sarah. I’m a Neuroscience PhD Candidate at Rosalind Franklin University, under [Dr. Grace Stutzmann](https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/academics/faculty/grace-e-stutzmann/).

My research focusses on intracellular organelle deficits in early neuronal pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our lab has shown that calcium dysregulation via an endoplasmic reticulum channel, the ryanodine-receptor (RyR), impairs neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity, resulting in cognitive decline. I have demonstrated that this aberrant calcium can disturb lysosome-mediated degradation of bulky protein deposits and disturb mitochondrial respiration, increasing cellular burden and toxicity.  Modulating the RyR with therapeutics was able to rescue these deficits in early stages of AD, opening up possibilities for therapeutic intervention.  This work has been done both in rodent models and inducible human neurons.

To achieve these goals, I perform calcium imaging, live-cell imaging, confocal microscopy, and generate human neurons. Additionally, immunofluorescence and molecular techniques are also applied.
